# Microfrontend with nextjs

Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. Here you will have 3 different apps built in React. Each of these apps work separately. It is used with modular federation which allows a JavaScript application to dynamically run code from another bundle/build, on client and server.

Module Federation in Next.js depends on @module-federation/nextjs-mf It will not work unless you have access to this plugin, which is not free.

# Usage

```
# Install dependencies in each app
npm install
```

```
# Run each app
npm run dev
```
